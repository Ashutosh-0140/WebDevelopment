  <h1>The Whispering Woods</h1>

  <h2>Chapter 1: The Uneasy Silence</h2>
  <p>It began with a whisper. Not the kind that tickles your ear on a windy night, but one that seeps into your bones. The village of Eldergrove had long feared the forest that bordered its edge—a dense stretch of ancient trees the locals called the Whispering Woods.</p>

  <p>Legend said that anyone who entered the woods after sundown would hear their name spoken softly by unseen voices. Most villagers kept far away. All except for Aila, a girl too curious to heed old stories.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 2: The Forbidden Path</h2>
  <p>One misty evening, driven by both boredom and a strange pull she couldn’t explain, Aila packed a satchel with lantern oil, biscuits, and her father’s old compass. With barely a sound, she slipped beyond the treeline.</p>

  <p>The air inside the forest was thick with secrets. Trees loomed like tall sentinels, and the path twisted like a living thing. But the whispers? They grew louder—with each step, they seemed to chant not just her name, but her memories. Her childhood laugh. Her mother’s lullaby.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 3: A Friend in the Fog</h2>
  <p>As the night deepened, Aila stumbled upon a clearing bathed in soft, silver light. In the center stood a stag, antlers glowing faintly. It didn’t run. Instead, it bowed.</p>

  <p>The whispers ceased.</p>

  <p>“You are seen,” the stag spoke without sound. “You are needed.” It gestured with its head toward a crumbled stone gate just beyond a ring of mushrooms.</p>

  <h2>Chapter 4: The Keeper's Secret</h2>
  <p>Beyond the gate, Aila found an ancient library carved into the roots of a massive tree. There, she met the Keeper—an old woman with eyes like moonlight. The library held stories of those who once heard the whispers and followed them: dreamers, misfits, protectors.</p>

  <p>“The woods whisper not to frighten,” the Keeper said, “but to awaken.”</p>

  <h2>Chapter 5: Returning With the Wind</h2>
  <p>When Aila returned to Eldergrove, days had passed. Or maybe years. Time worked differently in the woods. But she wasn’t afraid anymore. She walked with purpose, with stories inside her no one else had heard.</p>

  <p>And from that day forward, the village no longer feared the forest. Children played beneath its shade, and sometimes, just sometimes, they claimed to hear the trees calling out—not in menace, but in welcome.</p>

  <h3>The End</h3>
